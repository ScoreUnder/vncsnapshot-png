Known bugs in vncsnapshot:

 * The cursor may or may not appear in the snapshot. It is known to not
   appear in snapshots of Windows Tight VNC servers when connecting normally,
   and to appear when connecting via the server's 'Add New Client' option
   (i.e. -listen option for vncsnapshot). In addition, moving the cursor
   while vncsnapshot is connecting may result in the cursor being included
   in the snapshot. The -cursor and -nocursor attempt to control this, but
   are only workable for recent TightVNC servers.

 * When getting multiple snapshots (i.e. using -count with a value greater
   than 1) the second and subsequent images are messed up with some VNC
   servers. This has been observed with the KDE server ("KDE Desktop
   Sharing"), and with Ultra VNC.
